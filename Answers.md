1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a framework used to create components that dynamically render to the dom based on the data given to them.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

Thinking in react is a way to think about how we would want to render things depending on the data given to them, and how to pass that data around.

3. Describe state.

State is a snapshot of our data.

4. Describe props.

Props are what we use to share state among different components.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are things that happen outside our components which we want to keep track of. We can sync these effects to state or prop changes, by adding a dependency to our useEffect method within our component.
